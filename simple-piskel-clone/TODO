Todo:

  Required functionality:
    Functional scope:
      ☐ Canvas sizes: 32x32 / 64x64 / 128x128 user-defined units
      ☐ Tools
        ✔ Pen. Required size is 1 unit. Other unit sizes (2, 3, 4) are optional. @done(19-12-31 11:45)
        ✔ Color select (Primary/Secondary) @done(19-12-30 17:28)
        ☐ Paint bucket should fill closed areas (flood fill)
        ✔ Eraser @done(19-12-29 15:58)
        ☐ Stroke (to draw straight lines)
        ☐ Paint all pixels of the same color
      ☐ Please use Tools in https://www.piskelapp.com/ as an ideal example of what should be done. Use only main functionality without keyboard modifiers (ALT or SHIFT keys)
      ☐ Preview
        ☐ Small animation preview window in the top right corner
        ☐ Full screen mode
      ☐ Frames
        ☐ Ability to add/delete a frame
        ☐ Ability to reorder a frame via Drag and Drop
        ☐ Ability to duplicate a frame
      ☐ Please use Frames and Preview components of https://www.piskelapp.com/ as an ideal example of what should be done.
      ☐ Export the final result
        ☐ to local file system in any format (.gif / .apng)
      ☐ User session
        ☐ Current session should be saved and be accessible when user opens up the page again.
      ☐ Landing page. This page should include the following information:
        ☐ Screenshots
        ☐ Animation examples
        ☐ Implemented functionality overview
        ☐ Link to the editor itself
        ☐ Information about the author
      ☐ Keyboard shortcuts
        ☐ All actions should be available via keyboard shortcuts
          ☐ tools
          ☐ export
          ☐ add / delete / create frame
        ☐ Keyboard shortcuts should be available on hover
        ☐ Modal window to change keyboard shortcuts


    Technical requirements:
      ☐ Browser support: latest version of Google Chrome.
      ☐ Usage of JS/ES2015+ or TypeScript.
      ☐ You can use libraries and frameworks like React / Angular / Vue / jQuery / Bootstrap / Lodash / wrapper for file formats / API utilisation.
      ☐ Final version of the editor should be available via a link. The easiest way to do so is to host your project on GitHub pages / Google Firebase / Heroku / Netlify / any other hosting.
      ☐ Usage of Jest / any other tool for writing tests. You also need to setup test coverage output in the package.json by 'npm run coverage'. Your tests need cover the following code:
        ☐ Utilities, pure functions
        ☐ UI components
        ☐ Tools functionality (i.e. adding pixels, changing pixels, adding rectangle / circle)
      ☐ Have to use browser's Canvas API to draw frames.


    Requirements to the commits, PR, repository:
      ☐ stage2-tasks-requirements (`https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/ru/stage2-tasks-requirements.md`)
      ☐ worklog of the project

    Worklog:
      - To show process of development it needs to describe small amount of time and what work was accomplish during that time.
      
      `Example`
      You need to provide high level, feature base (what need to score) description. 
        | Start time  | End time | time spent |                feature                |
        |-------------|----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
        | May 27      | Jun 6    | 3h         | base structure of the project         |
        | Jun 7       | Jun 7    | 12h        | frame management implementation       |
        | Jun 7       | Jun 7    | 12h        | preview animation implementation      |
        | Jun 8       | Jun 10   | 8h         | keyboard shortcuts implementation     |
        | Jun 11      | Jun 12   | 5h         | layers implementation                 |
        | Jun 12      | Jun 12   | 10h        | bug fixing                            |
        
      Total: 50h

    Requirements to the quality of code:
      ☐ Don't use nested SetTimeout, synchronization of code using timeouts etc. Use promises/async/await where it's possible.
      ☐ Don't use magic number instead of named constants.  
        For example, instead of  
        `if (event.keyCode === 32 || event.keyCode === 13) {….}`  
        use  
        `if (event.keyCode === KeyboardEvent.SPACE || key === KeyboardEvent.ENTER ) {….}` etc.
      ☐ Don't use functions that have more than 40 lines of code (excluding variable declarations).
      ☐ Minimal use of ternary operators.
      ☐ Use pure functions where it's possible. If you haven't heard this term before, you can start your acquaintance [here](https://medium.com/@jamesjefferyuk/javascript-what-are-pure-functions-4d4d5392d49c) or [here](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976) 
      ☐ Use meaningful names for variables. Avoid single characters for variable names (i, n, j, d, etc.), abstract or common names (obj, arr, num, item1, etc.)
      ☐ Use the eslint with airbnb for all js code 

    Project structure. Organization of files and folders (example):
      - Usage of webpack is mandatory! Components directories should include all the needed resources and styles. For example, by removing folder `modal-dialog` all styles related to this dialog will be removed as well.

      Notes for Webpack usage: 
      - There is no point in putting your code inside an Immediately-invoked Function Expression.
      - There is no point in applying 'use strict' mode.
